Modern endpoint security requires continuous monitoring and rapid response capabilities. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides advanced threat protection and security monitoring tools that integrate seamlessly with your existing Microsoft 365 environment.

This post explores the key features of Microsoft Defender including threat detection, automated investigation and response, and security analytics. We'll also cover best practices for configuring alerts and building effective incident response workflows.

Effective security monitoring helps organizations detect and respond to threats before they can cause significant damage, while providing valuable insights into overall security posture.

This security monitoring topic complements the endpoint management concepts from my post on [Getting Started with Microsoft Intune]({{< ref "first-post.md" >}}).
