Conditional Access policies are the cornerstone of modern identity security, allowing organizations to enforce access controls based on user, device, and location context. This post provides a practical guide to implementing effective policies.

We'll explore common policy scenarios including multi-factor authentication requirements, device compliance checks, and location-based restrictions. Each policy type will be explained with real-world examples and implementation considerations.

Proper planning and testing of conditional access policies is essential to avoid disrupting legitimate user access while maintaining strong security posture.

This security topic relates to the identity management concepts discussed in my post on [Azure AD Security Best Practices]({{< ref "azure-ad-security-best-practices.md" >}}).
