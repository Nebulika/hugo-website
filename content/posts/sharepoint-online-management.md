SharePoint Online serves as the document management and collaboration backbone for many organizations. Effective management requires balancing user productivity with security and compliance requirements.

This post covers key administrative tasks including site collection management, permission structures, and content governance policies. We'll also explore modern SharePoint features and how they integrate with the broader Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

Understanding SharePoint administration is crucial for organizations looking to maximize the value of their Microsoft 365 investment while maintaining proper data governance.
