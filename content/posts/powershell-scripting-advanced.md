Building on basic PowerShell knowledge, this post explores advanced scripting techniques that can significantly enhance your automation capabilities. We'll cover error handling, parameter validation, and modular script design.

Advanced topics include working with custom objects, implementing logging and debugging features, and creating reusable script modules. These techniques help create robust, maintainable automation solutions.

Proper script design and documentation practices are essential for enterprise environments where scripts may be maintained by multiple team members over time.
