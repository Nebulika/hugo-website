# Dark Theme Design Principles

Dark themes have become increasingly popular in recent years. They're not just trendy - when done right, they can reduce eye strain and save battery life on OLED displays.

## Why Dark Themes Matter

### Benefits
- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Especially in low-light environments
- **Battery Savings**: On OLED displays, dark pixels consume less power
- **Focus**: Dark backgrounds help content stand out
- **Accessibility**: Can be easier for users with certain visual conditions

### Challenges
- **Contrast**: Maintaining proper contrast ratios
- **Color Choice**: Ensuring colors work well on dark backgrounds
- **Readability**: Text must remain crisp and clear

## Design Guidelines

### Color Palette

Choose your colors carefully:

```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #1a1a1a;
    --bg-secondary: #2d2d2d;
    --text-primary: #e0e0e0;
    --text-secondary: #b0b0b0;
    --accent: #6366f1;
}
```

### Typography

- Use slightly lighter font weights
- Increase letter spacing slightly
- Ensure sufficient contrast (at least 4.5:1)

### Visual Hierarchy

Create clear visual hierarchy through:
- **Size**: Larger elements draw attention
- **Color**: Brighter colors stand out
- **Spacing**: White space creates separation

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start with System Preferences**: Respect user's system theme preference
2. **Provide Toggle**: Allow users to override system preference
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Check all components in both themes
4. **Consider Images**: Ensure images work well on dark backgrounds

## Accessibility Considerations

- Maintain WCAG contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers
- Provide high contrast mode
- Consider users with light sensitivity

Remember: A good dark theme isn't just an inverted light theme - it requires thoughtful design and careful attention to detail.
