Identity is the new perimeter in modern cybersecurity. Azure Active Directory serves as the foundation for identity and access management in Microsoft 365 environments, making it crucial to implement robust security measures.

We'll also discuss monitoring and alerting configurations to help you detect and respond to potential security threats in real-time.
