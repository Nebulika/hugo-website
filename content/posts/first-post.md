Welcome to my first blog post! In this article, we'll dive into the basics of Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based service focused on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM).

Intune allows organizations to manage users' access to corporate applications and data on a variety of devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and computers. It is an integral part of the larger Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

For another perspective on managing endpoints, you might be interested in my post on [Advanced O365 Administration]({{< ref "second-post.md" >}}).
