This post focuses on some more advanced administrative tasks within Office 365. We will look at leveraging PowerShell scripts to automate user provisioning and license management, saving you valuable time.

This is a great follow-up to my previous post, where I discussed [Getting Started with Intune]({{< ref "first-post.md" >}}).
